            This is my first journal entry. Today we did a challange using pipes and a marble. The goal was to get it in to the bucket and through this challange we got to learn a lot. We learned how to work together and identify problems inorder to find a solution.

            This week we worked on our first project, the Rube Goldberg project. We started of with creating our project with CAD and designing what it would look like. After putting our heads together my team and I begain to bring it to life using cardbord and rulers.

            Today we finished and tried out out project. We created a simple and consistent design that will always work, are project is called "vroom vroom vroom". We started by darwing out and measuering everything we needed to cut so all we had to do after was put it together using tape. We brought cars from home to act as our wheels and bring the needle into the balloon. At times the car would flip over while going down but we just reajusted it and then everything worked smoothly.

            We dissected a computer and were able to learn about all the pieces that go in to creating the base. We took it apart and put it back together. I would say taking it apart was the easy part but going back and trying to connect the wires back together is where we struggled. In the end we got it to work and we were able to put it <together></together>

        Our project was to creat a hand. We struggled a lot because coming up with the perfect design took a lot of work. We originaly created a mitten hand however it was to small and didnt work. Then we creat one with individual fingers and that worked well eccept the string we were using to control the hand got in the way of picking up the bottle. We decided to ask for help to after looking at a friends desing we came up with a stronger plan. we decided to tape the string down and make individual joints to make the hand work.

        We created a CAD at the start and though the final product didnt look  lot like it, It allowed us to picture our ideas better. We used hot gleue and made 3 flaps to use as wings which we placed closer to the bottom of the 2 liter bottle which was out base. We also use paper to creat a cone and we placed that at the top of the bottle to act as our head. To lanch the bottle we filled it up with water, this acted as our fuel and alowed the rocket to thrust up in to the sky.

This week we focused on environmental engineering. Our job was to creat a water filter to clean dirty water. We used cotton at the bottom of our filter, sand for the next layer, then we put small pebbles on top of that, and our very first layer we used bigger pebbles. In the end even after filtering it many times the water still was not fully clean. We created a new filter with the same materials but we just doubled it. This worked a lot better and we got the water a little cleaner.        <img src="clean water1.jpeg" width="180px" height="120px"> <img src="clean water2.jpeg" width="180px" height="120px">
