            9/15/23 - Today we finished and tried out out project. We created a simple and consistent design that will always work, are project is called "vroom vroom vroom". We started by darwing out and measuering everything we needed to cut so all we had to do after was put it together using tape. We brought cars from home to act as our wheels and bring the needle into the balloon. At times the car would flip over while going down but we just reajusted it and then everything worked smoothly.

            9/29/23 - We dissected a computer and were able to learn about all the pieces that go in to creating the base. We took it apart and put it back together. I would say taking it apart was the easy part but going back and trying to connect the wires back together is where we struggled. In the end we got it to work and we were able to put it <together></together>

        10/6/23 - Our project was to creat a hand. We struggled a lot because coming up with the perfect design took a lot of work. We originaly created a mitten hand however it was to small and didnt work. Then we creat one with individual fingers and that worked well eccept the string we were using to control the hand got in the way of picking up the bottle. We decided to ask for help to after looking at a friends desing we came up with a stronger plan. we decided to tape the string down and make individual joints to make the hand work.
